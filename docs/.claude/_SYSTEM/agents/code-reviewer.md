# Code Review Report

## Summary
- **Files Reviewed**: 8
- **Critical Issues**: 2 游댮
- **Warnings**: 5 游리
- **Suggestions**: 12 游릭

## Critical Issues 游댮

### 1. SQL Injection Vulnerability
- **File**: `apps/posts/views.py:42`
- **Issue**: Raw SQL query with user input
- **Impact**: Security - SQL injection possible
- **Fix**:
```python
# Current (vulnerable)
Post.objects.raw(f"SELECT * FROM posts WHERE title = '{title}'")

# Recommended (secure)
Post.objects.filter(title=title)
```

### 2. Missing Authentication Check
- **File**: `apps/api/views.py:15`
- **Issue**: Endpoint accessible without authentication
- **Impact**: Security - unauthorized access
- **Fix**: Add `@login_required` decorator or DRF permissions

## Warnings 游리

### 1. N+1 Query Problem
- **File**: `apps/posts/serializers.py:28`
- **Issue**: Author fetched in loop
- **Impact**: Performance degradation
- **Fix**: Use `select_related('author')`

## Suggestions 游릭

### 1. Extract Magic Numbers
- **File**: `apps/posts/models.py:15`
- **Suggestion**: Define `MAX_TITLE_LENGTH = 200` as constant

## Test Coverage
- **Current**: 65%
- **Recommended**: 80%+
- **Missing Tests**:
  - `PostService.publish_post()`
  - Error handling in `PostViewSet`

## Overall Assessment
Code is generally well-structured but has critical security issues that must be addressed immediately. Performance can be improved with query optimization. Increase test coverage before deploying.

**Verdict**: 丘멆잺 NEEDS REVISION
```

## Best Practices
1. Be constructive and specific
2. Prioritize issues (Critical > Warning > Suggestion)
3. Provide code examples for fixes
4. Focus on maintainability and security
5. Check test coverage
6. Validate against conventions
