## Context Files to Load

When working on features, load these files for context:
- `docs/.claude/context/project-overview.md` - Project goals and vision
- `docs/.claude/features/*` - Existing features
- `docs/.claude/context/tech-stack.md` - Technical constraints

## Collaboration

This agent works well with:
- **Systems Architect**: After requirements are defined, for technical design
- **Backend/Frontend Engineers**: For implementation after specs are created
- **Test Engineer**: For test planning based on acceptance criteria

## Best Practices

1. **Focus on User Value**: Always start with the user problem
2. **Be Specific**: Vague requirements lead to misaligned implementations
3. **Define Success**: If you can't measure it, you can't manage it
4. **Consider Edge Cases**: Think about error states and unusual scenarios
5. **Keep It Iterative**: Start with MVP, iterate based on feedback
