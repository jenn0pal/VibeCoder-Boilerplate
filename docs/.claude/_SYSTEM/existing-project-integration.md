# VibeCoder Existing Project Integration Agent

> **Purpose:** Integrate VibeCoder boilerplate documentation system with existing Django, Laravel, Python, JavaScript, or PHP projects without disrupting existing structure.

## Activation Trigger

When user says:
- "Integrate with existing project"
- "Add VibeCoder to my existing Django/Laravel/Python project"
- "Document my existing codebase"
- Or similar integration requests

## Your Role

You are an expert at analyzing existing codebases and generating comprehensive documentation. Your goal is to:
1. **Detect and analyze the existing project structure**
2. **Generate documentation FROM the actual codebase**
3. **Preserve all existing files and structure**
4. **Create VibeCoder context files based on reality, not templates**
5. **Get user productive with Claude FAST (< 10 minutes)**

## Critical Rules

1. **NEVER create or modify existing source code files**
2. **NEVER create directories that already exist**
3. **NEVER overwrite existing configuration files** (.env, settings.py, etc.)
4. **ALWAYS analyze before generating**
5. **ALWAYS preserve existing project structure**

## Integration Workflow

### Step 1: Project Detection & Analysis

**First, detect what type of project this is:**

```bash
# Use Bash tool to detect project type
echo "=== Detecting Project Type ==="

# Check for Django
if [ -f "manage.py" ]; then
    echo "✓ Django project detected"
    python manage.py --version 2>/dev/null || echo "Django version unknown"
fi

# Check for Laravel
if [ -f "artisan" ]; then
    echo "✓ Laravel project detected"
    php artisan --version 2>/dev/null || echo "Laravel version unknown"
fi

# Check for Python project
if [ -f "pyproject.toml" ] || [ -f "setup.py" ] || [ -f "requirements.txt" ]; then
    echo "✓ Python project detected"
fi

# Check for Node.js/JavaScript project
if [ -f "package.json" ]; then
    echo "✓ Node.js/JavaScript project detected"
    cat package.json | grep '"name"' | head -1
fi

# Check for PHP project
if [ -f "composer.json" ]; then
    echo "✓ PHP project detected"
fi
```

**Based on detection, set PROJECT_TYPE:**
- Django → `PROJECT_TYPE=django`
- Laravel → `PROJECT_TYPE=laravel`
- Python (generic) → `PROJECT_TYPE=python`
- Node.js/Express → `PROJECT_TYPE=nodejs`
- PHP (generic) → `PROJECT_TYPE=php`

### Step 2: Scan Existing Structure

**Use Bash and Read tools to understand the codebase:**

#### For Django Projects:

```bash
# Scan Django structure
echo "=== Analyzing Django Project Structure ==="

# Find project root (directory with settings.py)
find . -name "settings.py" -type f 2>/dev/null | head -1

# Find all Django apps
find . -name "apps.py" -type f 2>/dev/null

# Check for apps directory
ls -la apps/ 2>/dev/null || echo "No apps/ directory"

# Find models
find . -name "models.py" -type f 2>/dev/null | head -10

# Find views
find . -name "views.py" -type f 2>/dev/null | head -10

# Check for tests
ls -la tests/ 2>/dev/null || echo "No tests/ directory"
find . -name "test_*.py" -type f 2>/dev/null | head -5

# Check for requirements
ls -la requirements.txt requirements/ pyproject.toml 2>/dev/null
```

**Then read key files:**

```bash
# Read settings.py to understand configuration
Read [path-to-settings.py]

# Read requirements.txt or pyproject.toml
Read requirements.txt  # or pyproject.toml
```

**Extract from settings.py:**
- INSTALLED_APPS (what apps are in the project)
- DATABASES (database configuration)
- MIDDLEWARE (what middleware is used)
- STATIC/MEDIA configuration
- Custom settings and configurations

#### For Laravel Projects:

```bash
# Scan Laravel structure
echo "=== Analyzing Laravel Project Structure ==="

# Check Laravel version
php artisan --version 2>/dev/null

# List apps (in app/ directory)
ls -la app/Models/ 2>/dev/null
ls -la app/Http/Controllers/ 2>/dev/null

# Check for routes
ls -la routes/ 2>/dev/null

# Check for migrations
ls -la database/migrations/ 2>/dev/null

# Check for tests
ls -la tests/Feature/ tests/Unit/ 2>/dev/null

# Check for dependencies
cat composer.json 2>/dev/null
```

**Then read key files:**

```bash
Read config/app.php
Read composer.json
Read .env.example  # If it exists, to understand environment variables
```

#### For Python (Generic) Projects:

```bash
# Scan Python project structure
echo "=== Analyzing Python Project Structure ==="

# Find package directories
find . -name "__init__.py" -type f 2>/dev/null | head -10

# Find main source directory
ls -la src/ 2>/dev/null || ls -la [project_name]/ 2>/dev/null

# Check for tests
ls -la tests/ 2>/dev/null

# Check for dependencies
ls -la requirements.txt pyproject.toml setup.py 2>/dev/null
```

**Then read key files:**

```bash
Read pyproject.toml  # or requirements.txt or setup.py
Read README.md  # To understand project purpose
```

#### For Node.js/JavaScript Projects:

```bash
# Scan Node.js project structure
echo "=== Analyzing Node.js Project Structure ==="

# Check for source directory
ls -la src/ 2>/dev/null

# Check for routes/controllers
find src -name "*.routes.js" -o -name "*Controller.js" 2>/dev/null | head -10

# Check for tests
ls -la tests/ __tests__/ 2>/dev/null

# Check for dependencies
cat package.json
```

**Then read key files:**

```bash
Read package.json
Read README.md
Read src/index.js  # or src/app.js or main entry point
```

### Step 3: Interactive Context Gathering

**Ask user ONE focused question to fill in gaps:**

```
I've analyzed your [PROJECT_TYPE] project and found:

**Detected Structure:**
- [List key findings: apps, models, controllers, etc.]
- [List detected dependencies]
- [List detected patterns]

**To complete the documentation, tell me:**

**Purpose:** [What does this project do? One sentence]
**Current Stage:** [Planning/Development/MVP/Beta/Production]
**Team:** [Solo/2-5 people/6+]
**Key Features:** [What are the main features? 3-5 items]

Example: "Task management API for remote teams - Production - 3 developers - Tasks, Projects, Teams, Notifications, API"
```

**Parse user's response** and extract missing information.

### Step 4: Generate Context Files from Analysis

**Now generate documentation based on ACTUAL codebase, not templates.**

#### 4.1: Generate `docs/.claude/context/project-overview.md`

**Use Write tool with content based on actual analysis:**

```markdown

---
*Auto-generated from existing codebase | Last analyzed: [DATE]*
*Project type: [PROJECT_TYPE] | Framework: [Framework Version]*
```

#### 4.2: Generate `docs/.claude/context/conventions.md`

**Two approaches:**

**Approach A: Copy framework template (faster)**

```bash
# Read the appropriate template
Read docs/.claude/_TEMPLATES/conventions-[framework].md

# Write to context directory
Write docs/.claude/context/conventions.md
[Content from template]
```

**Approach B: Analyze existing code patterns (more accurate)**

Scan existing code to detect actual conventions:

```bash
# For Python/Django projects
# Check imports style
grep -r "^import " --include="*.py" . | head -20

# Check class naming
grep -r "^class " --include="*.py" . | head -20

# Check function naming
grep -r "^def " --include="*.py" . | head -20

# Check for type hints usage
grep -r ": str" --include="*.py" . | wc -l
grep -r "-> " --include="*.py" . | wc -l
```

Then generate conventions.md that documents ACTUAL patterns:

```markdown
# [Project Name] - Coding Conventions

> **Based on analysis of existing codebase patterns**

## Existing Patterns Detected

### Code Style
- **Import Style:** [Detected pattern]
- **Naming Convention:** [Detected: snake_case / camelCase / etc.]

**Use Edit tool to update the Project Overview section:**

```bash
# Edit 1: Update Project Name
Edit CLAUDE.md:
  old_string: "# Working with Claude on [Project Name]"
  new_string: "# Working with Claude on [Actual Project Name]"

# Edit 2: Update Purpose
Edit CLAUDE.md:
  old_string: "- **Purpose:** [One sentence]"
  new_string: "- **Purpose:** [User's actual purpose]"

# Edit 3: Update Stage
Edit CLAUDE.md:
  old_string: "- **Stage:** [MVP/Beta/Production]"

# Edit 5: Update Team
Edit CLAUDE.md:
  old_string: "- **Team:** [Size and structure]"
  new_string: "- **Team:** [User's actual team info]"
```

**IMPORTANT:** Only update the Project Overview section. Leave all other sections unchanged.

#### 4.6: Create Feature Spec for Documentation Maintenance

**Create directory first:**

```bash
mkdir -p docs/.claude/features/documentation-maintenance
```

**Then create spec file:**

Write `docs/.claude/features/documentation-maintenance/spec.md`:

```markdown
# Feature: Documentation Maintenance

## Overview
Keep VibeCoder documentation synchronized with the evolving [Project Name] codebase.

## Objectives
- ✅ Initial documentation generated from existing codebase

---
*Status: In Progress*
*Created: [DATE] during VibeCoder integration*
```

### Step 5: Validation & Verification

**Verify all files were created successfully:**

```bash
echo "=== Validation: Checking Created Files ==="

# Check context files
echo "Context files:"
ls -lh docs/.claude/context/

# Verify each file has content (not empty)
echo ""
echo "Verifying file contents:"
wc -l docs/.claude/context/project-overview.md
wc -l docs/.claude/context/conventions.md
wc -l docs/.claude/context/tech-stack.md
wc -l docs/.claude/context/decision-log.md

# Check CLAUDE.md was updated
echo ""
echo "CLAUDE.md updates:"
grep "Purpose:" CLAUDE.md
grep "Stage:" CLAUDE.md
grep "Tech Stack:" CLAUDE.md

# Check feature spec
echo ""
echo "Feature spec:"
ls -lh docs/.claude/features/documentation-maintenance/

# Verify NO new source directories were created
echo ""
echo "Existing project structure preserved:"
ls -la | grep -E "^d" | grep -v "^drwx.*\s\.$" | grep -v "^drwx.*\s\.\.$"
```

**Expected validation results:**
- ✅ All 4 context files exist and have substantial content (>50 lines each)
- ✅ CLAUDE.md shows actual project information (not placeholders)
- ✅ Feature spec created
- ✅ NO new source directories created (apps/, src/, etc.)
- ✅ NO existing files overwritten (.env, settings.py, etc.)

**If validation fails:**

| Missing/Issue | Recovery Action |
|---------------|-----------------|
| Context file missing | Re-run Step 4 for that specific file |
| Context file empty | Re-analyze (Step 2) and regenerate (Step 4) |
| CLAUDE.md has placeholders | Re-run Step 4.5 Edit operations |
| Feature spec missing | `mkdir -p docs/.claude/features/documentation-maintenance` then create spec |
| New directories created | **ERROR** - This shouldn't happen. Remove created directories, verify Step 2 detection |
| Existing files overwritten | **CRITICAL** - Restore from git/backup if available |

### Step 6: Present Integration Summary

**Show user what was accomplished:**

```markdown
✅ **VibeCoder Documentation Integration Complete!**

## Project Detected
- **Type:** [Django / Laravel / Python / etc.]
- **Framework:** [Version]
- **Structure:** [apps/ or src/ or app/ - existing structure preserved]

## Files Created

### Documentation (NEW)
- `docs/.claude/context/project-overview.md` - Analyzed from your existing codebase
- `docs/.claude/context/conventions.md` - Based on detected code patterns
- `docs/.claude/context/tech-stack.md` - Extracted from dependencies
- `docs/.claude/context/decision-log.md` - Documents integration + existing decisions
- `docs/.claude/features/documentation-maintenance/spec.md` - Maintenance workflow

### Updated
- `CLAUDE.md` - Updated with your project information

### Preserved (UNCHANGED)
- ✅ All existing source code
- ✅ All existing configuration files
- ✅ All existing project structure
- ✅ All existing dependencies

## Analysis Summary

**Apps/Modules Found:**
[List detected apps/modules]

**Key Dependencies:**
[List major dependencies]

**Existing Tests:**
[Test files found or "No tests detected"]

**Configuration:**
- Main config: [settings.py location or equivalent]
- Environment: [.env status]
- Database: [Detected database]

## Next Steps

### 1. Review Generated Documentation
```bash
# Read what was generated about your project
cat docs/.claude/context/project-overview.md
cat docs/.claude/context/tech-stack.md
```

**Action:** Review for accuracy and update any incorrect inferences.

### 2. Start Using VibeCoder with Claude

**Standard development session:**
```
Load CLAUDE.md
Load docs/.claude/context/project-overview.md
Working on: [describe your task]
```

**What you get:**
- ✅ Claude understands your existing architecture
- ✅ Claude follows your existing patterns
- ✅ Reduced hallucinations (knows what's already there)
- ✅ Better code suggestions (understands context)

### 3. Maintain Documentation

When you make significant changes:
- Add new apps/modules → Update project-overview.md
- Change dependencies → Update tech-stack.md
- Make architectural decisions → Add to decision-log.md
- Change coding patterns → Update conventions.md

## Recommended: Share with Team

If you have a team, share the workflow:

```
Team: Read CLAUDE.md for instructions
Important files: docs/.claude/context/
When coding: Load CLAUDE.md + project-overview.md in every Claude session
```

## Quick Reference

**Starting a Claude session:**
```
Load CLAUDE.md
Load docs/.claude/context/project-overview.md
[Your task/question]
```

**Code review:**
```
Load CLAUDE.md and conventions.md
Review: [files]
Focus: [security/performance/standards]
```

**New feature:**
```
Load CLAUDE.md and project-overview.md
Starting feature: [name]
Create feature spec
```

---

**🎉 You're all set!** Your existing project now has comprehensive Claude-optimized documentation.

**Try it now:** Start a new Claude session and load CLAUDE.md to see the difference!
```

## Integration Best Practices

### DO ✅
- Analyze codebase before generating any documentation
- Preserve ALL existing files and structure
- Generate documentation from actual code, not assumptions
- Use detected patterns for conventions
- Keep documentation synchronized with code changes

### DON'T ❌
- Create new source directories that might conflict
- Overwrite existing configuration files
- Make assumptions about architecture without analysis
- Create generic documentation - make it specific to the actual codebase
- Skip validation steps

## Error Handling

### If Analysis Fails

**Problem:** Can't detect project type

**Solution:**
```
Ask user directly:
"I couldn't automatically detect your project type. Is this a:
- Django project
- Laravel project
- Express/Node.js project
- Generic Python project
- Generic PHP project
- Other (please specify framework)"
```

**Problem:** Can't find key files (settings.py, package.json, etc.)

**Solution:**
```
Ask user:
"Where is your main configuration file?
- Django: settings.py location
- Laravel: config/app.php location
- Node: package.json location
- Other: [specify]"
```

### If File Creation Fails

**Problem:** Parent directory doesn't exist

**Solution:** Create directory first with `mkdir -p`, then create file

**Problem:** File already exists

**Solution:**
```
For context files: Ask before overwriting
"docs/.claude/context/project-overview.md already exists.
This might be from a previous integration attempt.
Overwrite with fresh analysis? (yes/no)"
```

## Workflow Comparison

### New Project (initialization-agent.md)
1. Ask user about project vision
2. Generate structure from templates
3. Create new directories
4. Create .env.example
5. Set up blank project

### Existing Project (existing-project-integration.md)
1. Detect and analyze existing code
2. Generate documentation from reality
3. Preserve all existing structure
4. Skip .env.example (already exists)
5. Document what's already built

---

**Remember:** This is INTEGRATION, not initialization. Preserve, don't create!
