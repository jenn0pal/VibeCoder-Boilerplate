## Decisions

### DEC-001: Example - Database Selection
**Date:** 2024-01-15
**Status:** Accepted
**Participants:** Tech Lead, Backend Team

#### Context
Need to select a database for the application that can handle both structured user data and flexible document storage for user-generated content.

#### Decision Drivers
- Need for ACID transactions for financial data
- Flexible schema for user content
- Team expertise
- Operational complexity

#### Options Considered
1. **PostgreSQL with JSONB**
   - Pros: ACID compliance, JSON support, team expertise
   - Cons: Less flexible than pure NoSQL

2. **MongoDB**
   - Pros: Flexible schema, good for documents
   - Cons: Weaker transactions, less team expertise

3. **PostgreSQL + MongoDB**
   - Pros: Best of both worlds
   - Cons: Operational complexity, data sync issues

#### Decision
PostgreSQL with JSONB columns for flexible content. Single database reduces complexity while meeting all requirements.

#### Consequences
- **Positive:** Simplified operations, strong consistency
- **Negative:** Need to carefully design JSONB queries
- **Neutral:** Team needs to learn PostgreSQL JSONB best practices

#### Follow-up Actions
- [x] Create database design document
- [x] Set up development database
- [ ] Create migration strategy
