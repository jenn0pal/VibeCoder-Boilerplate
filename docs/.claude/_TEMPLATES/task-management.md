## 🔧 Task Management Best Practices

### Effective Task Creation
1. **Clear Title**: Descriptive and actionable
2. **Detailed Description**: Context and requirements
3. **Acceptance Criteria**: Measurable success conditions
4. **Proper Sizing**: Tasks should be 1-2 days max
5. **Dependencies**: Clearly identified and tracked
6. **Priority**: Based on business value and urgency

### Task Estimation Guidelines
```
Story Points Scale (Fibonacci):
1  - Trivial change (< 2 hours)
2  - Simple task (2-4 hours)
3  - Standard task (4-8 hours)
5  - Complex task (1-2 days)
8  - Very complex (2-3 days)
13 - Needs breakdown (> 3 days)
```

### Priority Matrix
```
         URGENT          NOT URGENT
    ┌──────────────┬──────────────┐
  I │ P1: Critical │ P2: High     │
  M │ Do Now       │ Schedule     │
  P ├──────────────┼──────────────┤
  O │ P3: Medium   │ P4: Low      │
  R │ Delegate     │ Backlog      │
  T └──────────────┴──────────────┘
    A
    N
    T
```
