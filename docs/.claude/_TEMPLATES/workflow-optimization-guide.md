## üéØ Workflow Patterns

### 1. Starting a New Feature
```markdown
## Optimal Prompt Structure
"Load CLAUDE.md and docs/.claude/context/project-overview.md
Starting feature: [name]
Spec at: docs/.claude/features/[name]/spec.md

Objectives:
1. [Specific goal 1]
2. [Specific goal 2]

Constraints:
- [Any limitations]
- [Performance requirements]

Please create implementation plan using todos."
```

### 2. Resuming Work
```markdown
## Continuation Prompt
"Load CLAUDE.md
Continuing: [feature-name]
Last completed: [what was done]
Current task: [what's in progress]
Today's goal: [specific objective]

Check docs/.claude/features/[name]/progress.md for status."
```

### 3. Debugging Session
```markdown
## Debug Prompt
"Load conventions.md
Issue: [description]
Error: [error message]
Context: [when it occurs]
Tried: [what you've attempted]

Please diagnose and fix."
```

### 4. Code Review
```markdown
## Review Prompt
"Activate Code Reviewer agent
Review scope: [files/PR]
Focus: [security/performance/standards]
Standards: docs/.claude/context/conventions.md

Please provide actionable feedback."
```

### 5. Refactoring
```markdown
## Refactor Prompt
"Current code: [file references]
Issues: [what needs improvement]
Goals: [desired outcome]
Constraints: [backwards compatibility, etc.]

Please refactor following our conventions."
```

---

## üí° Best Practices

### 1. Context Management

#### DO:
- Load only relevant context files
- Update context as you learn
- Archive obsolete information immediately
- Keep specs concise and current
- Reference file paths explicitly

#### DON'T:
- Load entire codebase at once
- Keep outdated information
- Use vague references
- Forget to update progress

### 2. Clear Communication

#### Effective Prompts:
```markdown
GOOD: "Implement user authentication using JWT, following our Django conventions at docs/.claude/context/conventions-django.md"

BAD: "Add auth"
```

#### Structured Requests:
```markdown
## Request Template
Context: [Current situation]
Problem: [What needs solving]
Requirements: [Specific needs]
Constraints: [Limitations]
Success Criteria: [How to measure]
```

### 3. Progressive Development

#### Incremental Approach:
1. Start with minimal implementation
2. Test and validate
3. Add features incrementally
4. Refactor as needed
5. Document changes

#### Task Breakdown:
```markdown
Epic ‚Üí Stories ‚Üí Tasks ‚Üí Subtasks
(Week) ‚Üí (Days) ‚Üí (Hours) ‚Üí (Minutes)
```

### 4. Documentation Discipline

#### Update Immediately:
- Decision made ‚Üí Update decisions.md
- Pattern discovered ‚Üí Update conventions.md
- Feature complete ‚Üí Archive spec
- Lesson learned ‚Üí Update guide

#### Documentation Hierarchy:
```
Official Docs (docs/)
    ‚Üë
Working Docs (.claude/features/)
    ‚Üë
Session Notes (progress.md)
    ‚Üë
Claude Conversation
```

## ü§ñ Agent Utilization Strategy

### Agent Selection Matrix
| Task Type | Primary Agent | Secondary Agent | When to Use |
|-----------|--------------|-----------------|-------------|
| New Feature | Product Manager | System Architect | Requirements ‚Üí Design |
| Implementation | Backend/Frontend Dev | Test Engineer | Build ‚Üí Test |
| Bug Fix | Debugging Agent | Code Reviewer | Fix ‚Üí Validate |
| Optimization | Performance Optimizer | System Architect | Profile ‚Üí Improve |
| Documentation | Documentation Specialist | - | Any major change |
| Security | Security Auditor | Code Reviewer | Regular audits |
| Deployment | DevOps Engineer | Test Engineer | Release preparation |

### Agent Chaining Patterns

#### Feature Development Chain:
```
Product Manager (requirements)
    ‚Üí System Architect (design)
        ‚Üí Backend Developer (API)
        ‚Üí Frontend Developer (UI)
            ‚Üí Test Engineer (testing)
                ‚Üí Documentation Specialist (docs)
                    ‚Üí DevOps Engineer (deploy)
```

#### Bug Resolution Chain:
```
Debugger (identify)
    ‚Üí Developer (fix)
        ‚Üí Test Engineer (verify)
            ‚Üí Code Reviewer (validate)
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Optimization Techniques

### 1. Context Optimization

#### Minimal Context Loading:
```python
# Priority Order
1. CLAUDE.md (always)
2. project-overview.md (if needed)
3. Feature spec (current work)
4. Conventions (when coding)
5. Other files (as required)
```

#### Context Caching Strategy:
- Keep frequently used patterns in conventions.md
- Store reusable prompts in prompts/
- Archive completed features immediately
- Use references instead of repetition

### 2. Prompt Engineering

#### Structured Prompts:
```markdown
## Task: [Clear title]
Input: [Specific data/files]
Process: [Steps to follow]
Output: [Expected result]
Format: [How to present]
```

#### Batch Operations:
```markdown
"Please perform these tasks:
1. Fix bug in auth.py:45
2. Add test for login function
3. Update API documentation
4. Create migration for new field

Use our conventions and track with todos."
```

### 3. Performance Optimization

#### Fast Iterations:
- Use hot reload in development
- Run tests in watch mode
- Keep feedback loops short
- Parallelize independent tasks

#### Efficient Reviews:
```markdown
"Review only changed lines in:
- src/auth.py (lines 45-67)
- tests/test_auth.py (lines 23-45)
Focus on security and performance."
```

### 4. Error Prevention

#### Validation Checklist:
- [ ] Requirements clear?
- [ ] Conventions loaded?
- [ ] Tests defined?
- [ ] Edge cases considered?
- [ ] Error handling planned?

#### Pre-implementation Review:
```markdown
"Before implementing, validate:
1. Approach aligns with architecture
2. No existing solution available
3. Performance implications acceptable
4. Security considerations addressed"
```
