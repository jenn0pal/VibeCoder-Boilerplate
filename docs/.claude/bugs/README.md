# Bug Tracking

This directory contains detailed bug reports for issues requiring investigation and resolution.

## Usage

### When to Create a Bug File

Create a bug file here when:
- The bug requires detailed investigation
- Multiple people need to collaborate on the fix
- The bug reveals an architectural issue
- You need to track reproduction steps and resolution

For simple bugs, you can use the "Fix a bug" prompt in CLAUDE.md directly without creating a file.

### File Naming Convention

```
BUG-[ID]-brief-description.md
```

**Examples:**
- `BUG-001-user-login-timeout.md`
- `BUG-002-api-rate-limit-bypass.md`
- `BUG-003-memory-leak-dashboard.md`

### Bug File Template

Copy from `docs/.claude/_TEMPLATES/task-management.md` (lines 109-152) or use this quick template:

## Bug Fixing Workflow

### 1. Create Bug Report
```bash
# Create bug file
cp docs/.claude/_TEMPLATES/task-management.md docs/.claude/bugs/BUG-001-description.md
# Edit to fill in details
```

### 2. Prioritize
- Critical/P1: Fix immediately
- High/P2: Current sprint
- Medium/P3: Next sprint
- Low/P4: Backlog

### 3. Fix the Bug
Start a Claude session:
```
Load CLAUDE.md and docs/.claude/context/conventions.md
Load docs/.claude/bugs/BUG-001-description.md

Please help me fix this bug following the workflow:
1. Write a failing test that reproduces the bug
2. Identify the root cause
3. Implement a fix
4. Verify the test passes
5. Add regression test
```

### 4. Document Resolution
Update the bug file with:
- Root cause analysis
- Fix applied
- Files changed
- Tests added
- PR link

### 5. Close Bug
After verification:
```bash
# Move to archive
mv docs/.claude/bugs/BUG-001-description.md docs/.claude/archive/bugs/
```

Or close the corresponding GitHub issue if tracking there.

## Bug Tracking Options

You can track bugs in multiple ways:

### Option 1: Local Files (This Directory)
**Best for:**
- Complex bugs requiring detailed investigation
- Architectural issues
- Bugs requiring team collaboration

### Option 2: GitHub Issues
**Best for:**
- Simple, straightforward bugs
- Integration with PR workflow
- Public projects
- Issue tracking and project boards

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach
- Use GitHub Issues for tracking and visibility
- Create local files for complex bugs requiring detailed notes
- Link the local file in the GitHub issue description

## Tips

1. **Write detailed reproduction steps** - Should be reproducible by anyone
2. **Include environment details** - Version, browser, OS, etc.
3. **Add screenshots/videos** - Visual evidence helps
4. **Document the "why"** - Not just the fix, but why it happened
5. **Write regression tests** - Prevent the bug from returning
6. **Update decision log** - If the bug reveals an architectural issue

## Example Bug Files

See `docs/.claude/_TEMPLATES/task-management.md` for the full bug report template.

**Remember**: The goal is not just to fix the bug, but to understand why it happened and prevent similar issues in the future.
